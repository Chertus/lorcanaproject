Buying single cards to augment your deck is a usual and customary part of TCG culture. It\u2019s also one of the biggest ways that game stores make their money, so buying some singles is a great way to give back to your host.",
    "You can also buy really nice official playmats with beautiful Lorcana art. These don\u2019t have zones marked. You don\u2019t need a playmat, but it helps protect your cards.",
    "They have the name of the Keyword in bold and the rule (explained in italics between parentheses). Eventually, keyword abilities become so commonly used that the cards will only have the bold Keyword printed on them \u2013 you\u2019ll have to remember or look up the effect.",

    "You can play lots of different types of the same character in your deck. You could have three or four different versions of Mickey! You can also have more than one of the same character out on the playing field at any time.",

    "Some abilities happen just once. Gramma Tala Storyteller might get banished early, but she gets you an extra ink for next turn when that happens. Note that she goes into the inkwell facedown and exerted so the ink can\u2019t be used this turn.",
    "This is a pile you keep just under your deck, with the cards face up. You or your opponent can look in both discards at any time you want. This helps to check what cards are used and what might be left.",
    "No, you can\u2019t use abilities on your opponent\u2019s turn. There might be cards that can but there are none now, unless specifically stated on the card like something triggering when an opponent does an action.",
    "Many cards have text on them that lets you use special abilities. There are all types of cool effects with helpful or clever uses. The best way of understanding the card is to read it and be very strict about the wording.",
    "After drawing the seven cards to their hand, each player gets one chance to alter them. This is commonly called a \u201cmulligan\u201d in card games.",
    "Items are played for their ink cost and put on the field above the inkwell. They come out ready and face up. They have unique abilities and can often be used turn after turn. You can play multiple items a turn if you can pay the ink.",
    "Then, you put the character from your hand onto your side of the table. Characters come into play Ready and face up. Put them near the top of your play area \u2013 above your inkwell cards. You can play as many character cards as you want if you can pay the ink.",
    "When a card is exerted, they can\u2019t take any other actions \u2013 unless they are readied by an effect. Also, only exerted characters can be chosen for a challenge. Choosing when to exert your characters is a key skill in Lorcana.",
    "The lower card in the stack is basically useless. It stays under the Shifted card and doesn\u2019t count as a separate character for rules purposes. Only the rules, stats, and abilities of the top card matter.",
    "Cards that let you play cards for less ink to play all say \u201cpay x less \u201c. It means you pay less ink to play it, it doesn\u2019t reduce the ink cost value of the card. So for other effects, their ink cost is still what is on the card.",
    "Item cards stay on the field until discarded or banished by their cost or another card\u2019s ability. They can\u2019t be targeted in challenges, and don\u2019t have Lore, strength, or willpower stats.",
    "Only cards that have the inkwell  symbol around the ink icon can be put into your inkwell to be used as ink. Any card type with the symbol can be inked. If you have no cards with the  symbol in your hand, you won\u2019t be able to add ink to your inkwell.",
    "This allows you to play a powerful character cheaper. The card literally goes on top of the other card and they become a single character in a stack.",
    "Any card that is banished or discarded is put into your discard pile.",
    "Scar Shameless Firebrand can ready an unlimited amount of your characters that cost 3  or less. With the right setup, that could be game-winning.",

Pick however many cards you\u2019d like to swap, place them on the bottom of the deck, and then draw new cards in equal number from the top. Then shuffle the deck.",
    "Characters can\u2019t do anything that requires them to exert  on their first turn as their ink still needs to dry",
    "Your play area on top is where characters and items go. The inkwell at the bottom is where you will place ink. You\u2019ll see some of these cards are stood up (ready) and some are sideways (exerted) \u2013 this is important and explained later.",
    "Games are played as best of three \u2013 though for casual play you don\u2019t have to do this. That means if you win twice, you win. We don\u2019t know how long rounds can go in official games yet \u2013 though 50 minutes for all three games is suggested.",
    "So if you want to play a Minnie Mouse Always Classy you need to pay one ink. If you want to play a Mufasa King of the Pride Lands, you\u2019ll need to pay six ink!",

    "Many abilities have an exert  symbol on them, meaning they should be exerted as part of the ability cost. It\u2019s called \u201ctapping\u201d in other card games.",
    "You might get a character in a standard, foil, or enchanted versions. These still all count as the same version of a card as they have the same full name. So you can\u2019t have more than four because they\u2019re shiny.",
    "In Lorcana, exert  is used in lots of ways: \u2013",
    "Characters can challenge with 0 strength if you want. There are no cards that can be played on your opponent\u2019s turn \u2013 yet. The oversize cards in the Gift Set aren\u2019t tournament legal \ud83d\ude41",
    "Ariel Whoseit Collector can be readied every time you play an item. She can do any action over and over with enough items and spare ink.",
    "The very first player, on the very first turn, begins by placing a card from their hand into their inkwell \u2014 which is just the place on the table in front of you where you put your ink, the resource you\u2019ll use to play other cards in the game. Converting cards to ink in this way removes them from the game \u2014 they can\u2019t be played for the remainder of that hand. To turn a card into ink, first show it to your opponent and then place it face down on the table in front of you. The first player can finish their turn as normal from there, either by playing a character, item, action, or song or taking some other available action \u2014 or no action at all. When they finish, play passes to the second player.",

    "Disney Lorcana, the brand-new trading card game by Ravensburger, is meant to be enjoyed by everyone \u2014 from hardcore collectors to absolute newbies. But the game draws on the rich traditions of the TCG genre, which were established some 30 years ago by games like Magic: The Gathering and the Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game. In this guide, we will try to get you up to speed as quickly as possible on how these kinds of games work. We\u2019ll cover the rules of Lorcana, how to get into collecting, and \u2014 most importantly \u2014 how to play the game with your local community of fans. Let\u2019s get started.",

    "Can a player do anything during their opponent\u2019s turn? Like can you play action cards if it\u2019s not your turn?",
    "Neoprene gaming mats are, in my opinion, more of an optional accessory. They have a little give to them, meaning that picking up cards is easier than off a flat table. But Lorcana involves a lot of sliding cards around, and I find that the spongy surface of the officially licensed mats can sometimes slow me down. Your mileage will vary, but with card sleeves alone you should be protected from most of the hazards associated with playing on a kitchen table or a bench at the local game shop.",
    "What if you make a mistake? Lewis said that\u2019s something you should hash out with your opponent before you draw your first card. \u201cIt really depends on the player,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cIf it\u2019s immediately caught, it\u2019s not unreasonable to ask to redo something. But if the game has progressed, then saying Oh wait! I don\u2019t want to do that! if you already know the result [is a bit of a bummer].\u201d",

    " means exert this card (or another if specified). X  means pay this much ink by exerting ink cards in your inkwell. If a card says , 3  you need to exert the card and pay three ink for the ability.",
    "After this, shuffle your deck again \u2013 including the cards you put back. People commonly mulligan to get more inkable cards, or put high-cost cards back to try and pull low-cost cards to play on the first few turns.",
    "You start in the Beginning Phase and do the same things in the same order every time. Then in the Main Phase, you can take any actions you\u2019d like at any point. There is no end step, you just pass to the next player.",
    "When you play a card, you should read any abilities it has and let the opponent see the card. It\u2019s good sportsmanship to say the ability even if it\u2019s not active straight away. Do the same when using abilities and actions.",

You can also swap them out for glass beads, six-sided dice, or bottle caps \u2014 whatever you have to hand, really, works just fine.",
    "You can play with more than two players! You just start with one player and move to the left (clockwise). Whenever an ability requires more than one player to do something at the same time, start with the player whose turn it is, then proceed to the left until each affected player has done their action.",
    "You can skip this step for your first EVER game. When you\u2019re first learning how to play Lorcana you probably won\u2019t know what to mulligan for. Play a full game first to see how it goes. Then for every game you play after you will always get a chance to mulligan.",
    "Some abilities have a unique name in white text on a brown border. Their name is often inspired by something that happens in their original Disney movie appearance. Others have a bold Keyword with explainer text (in parentheses and italics to explain the effect.)",
    "There is no hand size limit in Lorcana. There is also no limit to the number of cards in your inkwell or characters on the board. A card\u2019s Lore can\u2019t go below 0 \u2013 we think it\u2019s the same for other stats but it\u2019s not been confirmed.",
    "Great information.  Rules question:  Can I have my Dr. Facilier Charlatan on the board, then play a Just In Time Action card, and with that play Dr. Facilier Agent Provocateur for its Shift 5 cost?  Seems like a legit/intended line of play to me.  Any info would be appreciated.  Thanks!",
    "The second player, on their very first turn, will be the first to draw a card. Going forward, for each round of play after the first, each player will draw a card at the beginning of their turn. Play proceeds from there, with each player generating ink, playing cards using that ink, taking other actions, and then passing the turn to the other player.",
    "Dinglehopper sits on the field and can heal 1 damage just by being exerted. Musketeer Tabard only has to be paid for once, and its ability is always active. Beast\u2019s Mirror is quite expensive to play at 2 ink and use at the cost of 3 more ink and being exerted \u2013 but really helps when your options are limited with no cards in hand.",
    "Starter decks are preconstructed, meaning that they contain a curated selection of cards that all work together and contribute toward a shared strategy. Booster packs are assembled semi-randomly, drawing from the entire 200-plus set of cards that the game launches with. Boosters are a great way to find new cards so you can upgrade or alter a given deck, but they\u2019re not necessary if you\u2019re just getting started.",

Any box will do, but the Disney Lorcana ones are themed to match the cards you might be playing. While they are stiff and hard to open at first, they break in nicely. They\u2019re also water resistant, so they\u2019ll keep your cards safe if someone spills a whole drink at the table.",
    "You could have four Elsa Ice Surfer, four Elsa Queen Regent, four Elsa Spirit Of Winter, and four Elsa Snow Queen if you wanted. In theory, all sixteen of them could all be out on the field at the same time. As long as you can pay the ink (and find the table space) go for it!",

    "You\u2019re going to be doing a lot of shuffling in this game, and that will mean a lot of wear and tear on your cards. Can you ruffle and bridge those cards like a poker dealer? Sure, go right ahead. But you\u2019re likely to damage those cards over time. The solution? Card sleeves, deck boxes, and neoprene gaming mats.",
    "Abilities also have different ways of being activated, while some are passive and the ability always works. Some happen immediately when you play a card, others only work when a specific event triggers them.",
    "Every card has a list of classifications under their name and version. These tell us what group of characters they belong to. They include all types of traits about a character like if they\u2019re a Hero or Villian, a Sorcerer or a Dragon, and way more.",
    "To play a character card from your hand, you must pay its ink cost. The ink  icon in the top left of the card has a number. You pay that much ink to play the character by exerting  (turning sideways) that much ink in your inkwell.",
    "If a card somehow gets exerted and then readied again on its first turn \u2013 its ink still isn\u2019t dry and it still can\u2019t use abilities until the next turn. On the character\u2019s second turn on the board, they can take any action available to them.",
